# README

Build a simple URL shortening service using Ruby on Rails. The service should allow users
to do the following:
Requirements:
- Enter a long URL into a form.
- Submit the form and receive a shortened URL in return.
- Use the shortened URL to redirect to the original long URL.
- Expose an API with token for external web clients to create short URL
- Document the exposed API in swagger
- write spec for exposed API
The application should
- have a form for submitting long URLs.
- generate a unique shortened URL for each long URL submitted.
- store the long and shortened URLs in a database.
- redirect users to the original long URL when they visit the shortened URL.
